[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ed50f56e-4fc2-4c98-8b66-1e5074c6f3d3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/next-starter/deploys)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v9.5.0 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL)!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a sample API endpoint, a `netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=nextstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex)

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)
